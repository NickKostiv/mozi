#### JavaScript Functions:

1. **burgerMenu()** üçî - This function controls the behavior of the burger menu. When clicked, it toggles the visibility of the navigation menu. Additionally, it adjusts the appearance of the burger icon and locks/unlocks scrolling on the page. A breakpoint is set to close the menu when the window width exceeds 768.98 pixels.

2. **fixedNav()** ‚öì - This function fixes the navigation bar to the top of the page when the user scrolls beyond a specified breakpoint. It enhances user experience by keeping the navigation easily accessible.

#### Main Page Scripts:

- **SWIPER** üîÑ: This script initializes the Swiper plugin for a carousel/slider component. It includes navigation buttons, autoplay functionality with customizable delay, and responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes.

- **Counter About Brands** üî¢: This script activates a counter effect on elements with the class `.cards__item-title`. It dynamically updates the numeric values to create a counting animation effect. The animation triggers when the element enters the viewport during scrolling.
